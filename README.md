# Express Extract
## Description
Welcome to Express Extract, where I've crafted a React application as a playground for honing my skills, specifically diving into the world of Redux Toolkit. With just a copy-and-paste of an article's URL, our app seamlessly retrieves and presents you with a concise summary of the same article, powered by the Article Extractor and Summarizer from Rapid API. Effortless summarization at your fingertipsâ€”because your time is valuable!
